## Project Owner

CoMPAS is part of the [LF Energy Foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org/), a project of The Linux Foundation that supports 
open source innovation projects within the energy and electricity sectors.

## Technical Charter

The Project's [Technical Charter](blob-files/CoMPAS_Technical_Charter_2020-06-07.pdf) sets forth the responsibilities and 
procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the COMPAS Project.

## Committers

Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both 
write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers, 
but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect 
of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project owner.

## Responsibilities

The project is split into several repositories. There is at least one Committer in charge of each repository.
By "in charge", we mean:
- best effort to review the pull request,
- best effort to resolve issues,
- building and publishing the releases, including writing the release notes and informing the community,
- in case of inability to perform the above tasks, the Committer in charge has to ask the TSC through the list
  [CoMPAS-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org](mailto:CoMPAS-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org) to find another Committer to review the pull request,
  resolve the issue or build and publish the release.

Please refer to our [commiters file](https://github.com/com-pas/contributing/blob/master/COMMITERS.md) for more details about our work division.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is composed of voting members elected by the active Committers as described in the 
projectâ€™s Technical Charter. The TSC is responsible for the technical direction of the project.

### Members

CoMPAS TSC voting members can be fond the LFX project center. https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/ and look for the CoMPAS project

### Voting

While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project 
forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. The simple majority is needed to approve proposals.
The preferred way to vote is to create a poll [here](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/CoMPAS-tsc/addpoll).

## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. 
To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
